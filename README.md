2. **Fortran**
3. **Ada**

The problems have been described in the official [ProjectEuler Website](https://projecteuler.net/).


### <br>Installation

1. To change the icons, use the following command: `./iconify`

2. To compile the projects and produce executables, use the following command: `./make`

3. To run and view the results of the C, Fortran, and Ada executables of a particular project, say PROBLEM-001, use the following command:

* `./run 1`

<br>
To clean the projects, by removing the executables and restoring the folder to its former state, use the following command: 

 <br> `./make clean`
