### <br>Description

A series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems, solved using the following programming languages:

1. **C**
2. **Fortran**
3. **Ada**

The problems have been described in the official [ProjectEuler Website](https://projecteuler.net/).


### <br>Installation

These instructions are primarily for the Ubuntu/Linux system. First, open a command terminal. Then, go to the **ProjectEuler** folder by using the `cd` command.

1. To change the icons, use the following command: `./iconify`

2. To compile the projects and produce executables, use the following command: `./make`

3. To run the C, Fortran, and Ada executables of a particular project, say PROBLEM-001, use the following commands respectively:

`./run 1 c`

`./run 1 f`

`./run 1 a`

To clean the projects by removing the executables are restoring the folder to its former state, use the following command:<br>
